# Task-Manager
This repo is about a Task Manager which allows users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks. Users can provide a title, description, and due date for each task. The app displays tasks in a list and includes a responsive design, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices. Tasks are saved in local storage.
# React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To run this Vite + React application, you need to follow these steps:

1.Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed as Vite requires Node.js to be installed on your system.


2.Install Vite:

      npm create vite@latest my-vite-app -- --template react
      cd my-vite-app
      npm install

3.Place the HTML file: Ensure the provided HTML file (index.html) is in the public directory of your Vite project or replace the default index.html in the root directory with the provided one.

4.start development server
     npm run dev
This command will start the Vite development server and you can view the application in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.

5.Develop Your React Application: The main entry point of your React application is specified in the script tag of the HTML file (/src/main.jsx). You can start coding your React components and logic in this file and others as needed.
